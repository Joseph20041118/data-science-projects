# COVID-19 Interactive Dashboard

This project builds an interactive dashboard to visualize **COVID-19 cases and trends** using Python.  
The goal is to practice **time-series analysis, data cleaning, and interactive visualization** with libraries like **Plotly** and **Streamlit/Dash**.

## ðŸ”¹ Pipeline Overview
1. **Load Data**  
   - Download daily COVID-19 case data (Johns Hopkins University / Our World in Data)  
   - Fallback: use a local CSV in `data/covid.csv`

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Parse dates, handle missing values  
   - Aggregate by country / region  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Time-series plots of confirmed cases, deaths, vaccinations  
   - Comparisons across multiple countries  
   - Interactive filters (date range, region, metric)

4. **Dashboard App**  
   - Built with **Streamlit** (or Plotly Dash)  
   - Supports dropdown filters, sliders, and real-time plots  

5. **Export & Deployment**  
   - Save static plots into `plots/` folder  
   - Run app locally: `streamlit run app.py`
